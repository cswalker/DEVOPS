# A word about variable substitution and notation
# dot notation will always be interpreted literally
# bracket notation will allow for substitution when the substitution string is the name of an existing variable
#
# e.g.
# aws.account.subprod will not substitute `subprod`
# aws.account["subprod"] will allow for substitution of `subprod` if subprod is a variable
  # otherwise it is interpreted literally
# substittuions will occur only when encapsulating the variable with "{{  }}"

# Tenancy is top level that has ownership over all other resources
